Wizarding World  -- Guide Content Exporter

Produces scripts/guide_content.json containing ALL curated guide data:
wand tables, boss data, enemy tables, NPC lists, accessory tables,
progression text, system descriptions, and lore-sensitive content.

This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for guide narrative content.
The PDF generators read this file instead of hardcoding arrays.

IMPORTANT: This is manually maintained content, NOT auto-derived from code.
When you change game content, update this file to match.
The verification script checks for common stale patterns.

Usage:
    python scripts/export_guide_data.py            # write guide_content.json
    python scripts/export_guide_data.py --check     # validate structure only
