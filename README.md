> **Disclaimer.** This is an **unofficial fan project**. Harry Potter, Hogwarts, the wizarding-world setting, and all related names, characters, places, and indicia are trademarks of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., J.K. Rowling, and other rights holders. This mod is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by** any rights holder. Non-commercial fan use only — see [License & IP disclaimer](#license--ip-disclaimer) at the bottom.

> **Project status — release candidate.** The primary single-player progression route has been smoke-tested in tModLoader from early game through Voldemort and the Deathly Hallows ending. The mod is **not yet on Steam Workshop**; remaining release work is focused on wider balance, multiplayer sync, and packaging checks.

A comprehensive Harry Potter Hogwarts experience mod for Terraria via tModLoader. **593 C# source files, 606 PNG sprites, 1,509 project files.** Canon-audited and redesigned with cleaner Hallows/Horcrux progression and stronger late-game consistency.

**Core Identity:** You are a Hogwarts student experiencing memories from across wizarding history through a Pensieve, learning spells, mastering your wand, and facing the rising darkness.

**Highlights:**
- **12 multi-phase bosses** with Voldemort as the true final boss (Horcrux Hunt mechanic)
- **Dark Arts Corruption System** — dark magic is tempting but genuinely costly
- **Wandlore System** — 18 wood types, 5 cores, 9 spell schools
- **Pensieve Memory Framework** — solves mixed-era lore, enables boss replay
- **Horcrux Hunt** — destroy the 4 core Horcruxes, hunt Nagini, and weaken Voldemort before the final battle
- **Master of Death** — survival/fate-oriented hidden set bonus (not raw DPS)
- **Utility Magic** — Alohomora (opens doors), Reparo (ward/room repair), Accio (item attraction)
- **Class Quest System** — DADA, Potions, Creatures, Charms with mastery levels
- **Quidditch Season** — Seeker ranks, multi-Snitch events, broom trials
- **Hogsmeade Village** — worldgen town with Shrieking Shack
- **Forbidden Forest** — 3-zone depth scaling with progressive danger
- 78 enemies, 65 accessories, 8 armor sets, 5 mounts, 6 pets total, 19 potions
- 3-language support (English, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional)
- Canon-audited: true Invisibility Cloak is unique, Gaunt's Ring awakens the Resurrection Stone, Demiguise gear is ordinary stealth gear

## 【new】 Release QA Summary

As of July 1, 2026, Wizarding World is treated as a **1.0.0 release candidate**. The focus is no longer adding new systems; the current scope is packaging, publishing, and wider community validation.

Completed content and packaging:

- Core content is in place: 12 Wizarding World bosses, 24 active wands, 78 enemies, 65 accessories, 16 town NPCs, 8 armor sets, 5 mounts, 6 pets, 19 potions, and three-language localization.
- In-game PNG asset coverage is complete and tracked by `scripts/verify_assets.py`.
- Custom spell, boss, enemy, and ambient audio has been generated, wired, and smoke-tested.
- Release packaging is ready: public Release builds omit `/wwdebug`, `WizardDebugCommand`, and the QA-only test wand.
- Workshop / Mod Browser copy, release checklist, and release manifest are maintained in `description.txt`, `docs/WORKSHOP_PAGE.md`, `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, and `release_manifest.json`.

Completed smoke-test coverage:

- Early route: Hogwarts Letter, first wand, Enchanting Table, Ollivander/Hagrid unlocks, Mountain Troll, Quirrell, and Basilisk.
- Mid route: Aragog, Fluffy, Horntail, mechanical boss gate, and post-Horntail entry systems.
- Late-hardmode route: Umbridge, Fenrir, Bellatrix, Barty Crouch Jr, Dementor King, and Voldemort readiness.
- Final route: Horcrux Hunt, Nagini / Battle of Hogwarts gates, Lord Voldemort summon and defeat, Deathly Hallows claim / purification / Master of Death attunement.
- Persistence checks: key boss defeat flags and final-route flags were verified after Save & Exit / reload.
- Release smoke: `dotnet build -c Release --no-restore` succeeds with 0 warnings / 0 errors, the generated `.tmod` loads in tModLoader, and `Mod Load Completed` appears in `client.log`.

Current verification snapshot:

- `python scripts/verify_assets.py` passes.
- `python scripts/verify_guide.py --strict` passes with `665 passed, 0 failed, 0 warnings`.
- `python scripts/scan_content.py --pretty` reports `593 C# files`, `606 PNGs`, and `1509 total` project files.

Remaining pre-public-release confidence work is limited to fresh-machine installs, longer balance runs, multiplayer sync checks, and native-speaker proofreading.

## Installation

1. Install **tModLoader** from Steam (free DLC for Terraria)
2. Install the **.NET 8 SDK** if not already installed
3. Copy the `WizardingWorld` folder to your tModLoader mod development directory:
   - Windows: `%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\ModSources\`
4. Open tModLoader, go to **Workshop > Develop Mods > Build + Reload**
5. The mod will compile and load automatically

## Getting Started

When you first use a Life Crystal or defeat a boss, an owl will deliver your **Hogwarts Acceptance Letter** at dawn. This gives you a free **Oak Wand** and introduces the mod's systems.

**Your first steps:**
1. Craft an **Enchanting Table** (Wood + Books + Fallen Stars + Amethyst) at a Workbench
2. Use the Enchanting Table to craft better wands, potions, and magical gear
3. **Ollivander** the wandmaker will move in once you have a wand
4. Explore the world — a **Wizard Tower** has spawned with starter loot
5. Defeat magical creatures to collect **Essence of Magic** (universal crafting material)
6. Follow the **Boss Compass** and **Wizard's Almanac** through the 12-boss route, ending with **Lord Voldemort** and the Deathly Hallows finale

## 【new】 Looking for help

This mod is in release-candidate shape. The core content pass is complete: in-game assets are present, release packaging is ready, debug-only QA tools are excluded from public Release builds, and the primary single-player route has been tested from early game through all 12 bosses, Voldemort, and the Deathly Hallows ending.

The remaining help wanted is focused on wider release confidence rather than adding more content. If any of these match what you'd like to work on, browse [open issues](https://github.com/lillly1/WizardingWorld/issues) or open a new one. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build setup.

Already completed:

- Primary single-player route QA from Hogwarts Letter through Voldemort and Deathly Hallows.
- Early, mid, post-Horntail, Umbridge, Fenrir, Bellatrix, Barty, Dementor King, Voldemort, and Hallows QA slices.
- Sprite coverage and asset verification.
- Custom spell, boss, enemy, and ambient audio pass.
- Release packaging, Workshop copy, and upload checklist.

| Need | What it looks like | Label |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| **Fresh-machine testers** | Install from a clean clone or Workshop-style package and confirm the mod builds, loads, and starts correctly outside the maintainer machine. | `fresh-install` |
| **Multiplayer-sync verifiers** | Specifically test `Common/Players/` and `Common/Systems/` paths in 2+ player co-op (save/load, host-vs-client desyncs). | `multiplayer-sync` |
| **Balance reviewers** | Run longer normal play sessions and flag obvious outliers in wand DPS, mana cost, boss HP curves, shop timing, drops, and summon costs. | `balance` |
| **Localization proofreaders** | Native-speaker proofreading for English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese text in `Localization/`, especially quest guidance and boss route text. | `localization` |
| **Multiplayer playtesters** | Play the boss route or major systems in co-op and report progression, NPC shop, event, or world-save issues. | `co-op-test` |
| **Sprite polish artists** | Optional polish pass on existing generated sprites while preserving current content coverage and item readability. | `sprite-polish` |
| **Canon-audit reviewers** | Optional review for tone, naming, and lore consistency. Avoid large new content proposals unless they come with a clear scope. | `audit` |

Issues are tagged with the labels above. The maintainer has limited bandwidth, so:

- **Take ownership** — comment "I'll take this" on an issue, work on a fork, open a PR.
- **Small first PR** — a single sprite polish, a typo fix, a balance tweak with rationale. Big rewrites need an issue first.
- **Discussions** — design questions / ideas / "should we do X?" go in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/lillly1/WizardingWorld/discussions), not issues.
