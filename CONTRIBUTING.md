# Contributing to Wizarding World

Thanks for the interest. This is a single-maintainer fan project at the **design-complete, not-yet-playtested** stage — meaning every contribution that puts eyeballs on the actual gameplay (playtest, balance, multiplayer sync, sprite polish, localization) is high-leverage. The maintainer has limited bandwidth; collaborators who **take ownership of an issue** are exactly what the project needs.

See the **[Looking for help](README.md#looking-for-help)** section in the README for the six current collaboration tracks and their labels. Browse [open issues](https://github.com/SamSi0322/WizardingWorld/issues) or open a new one — comment "I'll take this" to claim, work on a fork, open a PR.

Pull requests are welcome — please skim the constraints below before sinking time into a large change.

## Quick start (building the mod)

This is a tModLoader mod, not a standalone .NET project. You **cannot** `dotnet build` it from a checkout alone — the csproj imports `../tModLoader.targets`, which lives inside your tModLoader install directory.

1. Install **tModLoader** from Steam (free DLC for Terraria).
2. Install the **.NET 8 SDK**.
3. Clone this repo into your tModLoader `ModSources/` folder:
   - Windows: `%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\ModSources\WizardingWorld\`
   - Linux: `~/.local/share/Terraria/tModLoader/ModSources/WizardingWorld/`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Terraria/tModLoader/ModSources/WizardingWorld/`
4. Open tModLoader → **Workshop → Develop Mods → Build + Reload**.

For deeper architecture and naming conventions, read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (project context), [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (build commands & style), and [`ContentManifest.md`](ContentManifest.md) (content inventory).

## Reporting bugs

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/SamSi0322/WizardingWorld/issues) with:

- tModLoader version + .NET SDK version + OS
- Mod version (top of `build.txt`)
- Reproduction steps — a "do X, observe Y" path or a save file
- The relevant tModLoader log if there's a crash (`%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\Logs\` on Windows)

## Proposing changes

For non-trivial changes, open an issue first describing the problem and your approach. Changes touching `Common/Players/` or `Common/Systems/` need save/load and multiplayer-sync verification before merge.

### Code style

- **Tabs** for indentation.
- C# identifiers: PascalCase for public types and members, camelCase for locals and fields.
- Namespaces mirror folder paths: `WizardingWorld.Content.Items.Weapons`.
- One main type per file; file naming follows existing patterns (`[BossName]Boss.cs`, `[SpellName]Projectile.cs`, `[HouseName]Robes.cs`).
- When renaming content, update all three localization HJSON files (`Localization/`) at once.
- If guide counts or progression data change, run `python scripts/verify_guide.py` and regenerate the affected PDF (`generate_english_pdf.py` / `generate_chinese_pdf.py`).

### Testing

There's no automated test suite — `dotnet test` will not work for a tModLoader mod. Every change should:

- Build without errors inside tModLoader.
- Load without missing-asset or localization errors.
- Be smoke-tested in-game on a fresh character (exercise the changed content path).
- For `Common/Players/` and `Common/Systems/`: include save/load and multiplayer-sync verification.

## What's out of scope

PRs that bolt on these without prior discussion are likely to be closed:

- Cosmetic-only refactors of large content files.
- Changes that contradict the canon-audited Hallows / Horcrux / Master-of-Death progression.
- **Any third-party Harry Potter IP**: sprite rips from films, audio from games, copyrighted text from books. Self-created sprites and original audio only — see the IP note below.
